            <div><h4 class="text-center py-3"><u>Academic excellence</u></h4>
            <p>We incorporate the best practices of international teaching methods along with the Indian values of rigor, homework, respect for elders, etc. This gives our young learners the advantage of a wider scope of learning, while covering the essentials on each topic, and ensuring that they understand each concept thoroughly.Our Central Academic & Research Team (CART), comprising of highly qualified and experienced academicians, provides curriculum, training, and support to all our schools across India to ensure standardization.To help each of our students learn better and excel in academics, we have defined processes and set measures in place to ensure that no student is left behind in the learning process.</p></div>
           </div>
           <div>
            <div><h4 class="text-center py-3"><u>Personsl Attention</u></h4>
            <p>Just as parents are teachers at home, teachers are parents in school.
                Our teachers are not just limited to classroom teaching, but play a bigger role in each child’s life. A teacher is not only teaching her subject to the students but also constantly teaching her students, values and life lessons that a parent would want to impart in them.</p></div>
           </div>
           <div>
            <div><h4 class="text-center py-3"><u>Holistic Development</u></h4>
            <p>Education is not limited to the four walls of the classroom. We believe in the holistic development of a child that would lead to more than just qualifications when he faces the real world after school. Practical learning, a wide range of activities that increase student’s exposure forming well-rounded personalities are what we aim at.Students are also encouraged to be involved in sports activities and performing arts, to participate and perform in various inter-school, state level, national and international competitions.Hands-on Learning</p></div>
<div><h4 class="text-center py-3"><u>Best-in-class Infrastructure</u></h4>
<p>Our campuses are facilitated by the world-class infrastructure for academic and co-curricular activities. Our aesthetically and ergonomically designed classrooms make learning easier by removing physical hindrances and ensure that students are focused on learning.Equipped with modern infrastructures like Digi-boards, Science Lab, Robotics Lab. We enable every child to explore new ideas and learn through hands-on experiences. The campuses also offer facilities like swimming pools, skating rinks and play areas that extend learning beyond classrooms.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h4 class="text-center py-3"><u>Safe Campus</u></h4>
    <p>SAFETYFrom the moment our students leave their homes, we ensure their safety. The buses are equipped with GPS for the parents to keep track of their child’s location. The GPS also updates the parents if a bus exceeds speed limits on his route. We conduct daily Breath-analyzer Tests of our drivers to prevent drunk and driving at all costs.To ensure additional safety, we make sure that each and every bus consists of at least one female staff. This works as an extra protection for the children with an adult’s guided help and support.</p>
